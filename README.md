# Navver

A chrome extension for mouseless navigation, stealing some commands from VIM.

## Usage

Press `f` to launch the navigator. All links on the page will be highlighted
and you can search either by the label (a two character code) or the link text.

Pressing `Enter` will open either focus inputs or click on links, depending
on the context.

`Shift+Enter` will open in a new window.

Use `k` and `j` to scroll up and down.
Use `h` and `l` to scroll left and right.

Use `gg` to scroll to the top of the page, and `G` to scroll to the bottom.
