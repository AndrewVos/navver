# Navver

A chrome extension for mouseless navigation, stealing some commands from VIM.

## Usage

Press `f` to launch the navigator. All links on the page will be highlighted
and you can search either by the label (a two character code) or the link text.

Use `k` and `j` to scroll up and down respectively.

Use `gg` to scroll to the top of the page, and `G` to scroll to the bottom.
