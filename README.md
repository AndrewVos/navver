# Navver

A chrome extension for mouseless navigation, stealing some commands from VIM.

## Usage

### Focusing links and inputs

Press `f` and then type in the label of the input or link you want to interact with.

You can then press `Enter` or `Ctrl-Enter` to open links either in the current window
or in a new tab, respectively. These are the default key bindings that Chrome uses and
may be different on OSX.

### Scrolling

- Use `k` and `j` to scroll up and down.
- Use `h` and `l` to scroll left and right.
- Use `gg` to scroll to the top of the page, and `G` to scroll to the bottom.

### Navigating back and forth

- Use `gb` to go back
- Use `gf` to go forward
